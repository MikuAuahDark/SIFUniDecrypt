LL!SIF UniDecrypt
=================

This is, [HonokaMiku](https://www.github.com/MikuAuahDark/HonokaMiku) port for PHP, which means you can decrypt files
on your websites without have to invoke external application. It requires
PHP 7 to run (or PHP 5.6 if you decided to remove the whole type hinting in the code)

It's based on HonokaMiku v4.2.1

Supported Features
==================

At the moment, only V2 and V3 decryption format is supported. V1 decryption is planeed
in the future.

Some HonokaMiku function is also missing (mostly in the helpers) but this implementation
is sufficient to decrypt and encrypt files.
